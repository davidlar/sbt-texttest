texttestTestPathSelection

  texttest path selection, sent to texttest with '-ts' flag. Optional.

texttestGlobalInstall

  Whether to install this suite of texttests under $TEXTTEST_HOME. Defaults to true.

texttestExecutable

  Full path to the texttest executable. If it is on your $PATH then you do not need to set this.

texttestAppName

  texttest application name, sent to texttest with '-a' flag. Defaults to {name.value}.

texttestTestCaseLocation

  Where the texttest test cases are located in this repo. Defaults to {baseDirectory.value}/it/texttest

texttestExtraSearchDirectory

  What folder to use for the 'extra_search_directory' setting you may have in your config.app file. This plugin will write an interpreter_options file containing the CLASSPATH to this folder, if you set the property 'texttestInstallClasspath' to true. Defaults to {target.value}/texttest_extra_config

texttestInstallClasspath

  Whether to add the project's classpath to the environment used when running your tests. Defaults to true.

texttestBatchSessionName

  texttest batch session name, sent to texttest with '-b' flag. Defaults to 'all'

texttestRoot

  The path to TEXTTEST_ROOT - ie where the texttest runner will find your test cases. If the parameter 'texttestGlobalInstall' is set to true, then this must be set, and is expected to be a global location on your machine where you may have many test suites installed. If you don't set this value, we use the environment variable $TEXTTEST_ROOT If that is not set, we will use the environment variable $TEXTTEST_HOME as a fallback option. If neither are set, we use the value of 'texttestTestCaseLocation' as a last resort.

texttestTestNameSelection

  texttest test name selection, sent to texttest with '-t' flag. Optional.

texttestRun

  run texttests found under it/texttest

texttestInstall

  install texttests under TEXTTEST_HOME, and create classpath file needed for tests to run.
